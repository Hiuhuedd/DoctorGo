============================INSTRUCTIONS FOR RUNNING APP PREVIEW====================================
1. Go to Google playstore/ App store and download the Expo-go application.
2. Open the Expo-go app.
3. Go ahead and paste this url: exp://exp.host/@hiuhu/drgo5, *in the Enter URL manually
4. Enjoy!
============================INSTRUCTIONS FOR RUNNING APP TESTS====================================
1. Clone the repository: First, you need to clone the repository that contains the React Native Expo application code. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to store the project. Then, use the following command to clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Hiuhuedd/DoctorGo.git

2.  Install dependencies: Once you have cloned the repository, navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies. You can use the following command to do this:
cd DoctorGo
yarn install

3. Run the application: Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the application using Expo. To do this, use the following command:
expo start

4. Test the application: With the development server running, you can test the application on a device or simulator. To do this, you will need to install the Expo client app on your device or simulator

If you're using a physical device, you can install the Expo client app from the App Store or Google Play Store. Once you have the app installed, open it and scan the QR code that appears in the Expo DevTools to load the app.

If you're using a simulator, you can install the Expo client app by running the following command in your terminal:
npm install -g expo-cli

5. Once the Expo client app is installed, you can open it and load the app by selecting it from the list of available projects.

Test and debug the application: With the app loaded on your device or simulator, you can test it and debug any issues that arise. You can use the Expo DevTools to view console logs and debug the app in real-time.
That's it! With these steps, you should be able to test a React Native Expo application from code hosted on GitHub. Good luck!
